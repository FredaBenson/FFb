    <h1>All About Sharks</h1>
    <h2>Many sharks are very unique</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Hammerhead Shark</h3>
    <img src="images/hammerhead shark.jpg" alt="HammmerHead Shark">
    <h3>This shark's unusual name comes from the unusual shape of its head, an amazing piece of anatomy built to maximize the fish's ability to find its favorite meal: stingrays.</h3>
    <h3>A hammerhead shark uses its wide head to trap stingrays by pinning them to the seafloor.</h3>
    <h3>The shark's eye placement, on each end of its very wide head, allows it to scan more area more quickly than other sharks can.</h3>
    <h3>The hammerhead also has special sensors across its head that helps it scan for food in the ocean.</h3>
    <hr>
    <h3>Great White Shark</h3>
    <img src="images/Great white sharks.jpg" alt="Great White Shark">
    <h3>Great white sharks are torpedo-shaped with powerful tails that can propel them through the water at up to 35 miles per hour.</h3>
    <h3>The great white shark is a type of mackerel shark from the Lamnidae family, which also includes mako sharks, salmon sharks, and porbeagle sharks.</h3>
    <h3>Great whites are the largest of the bunch—and the world’s largest predatory fish.</h3>
    <h3>Great whites are named after their white underbellies, but their topsides can come in a variety of browns and grays.</h3>
    <hr>
    <h3>Whale Shark</h3>
    <img src="images/Whale Shar.jpg" alt="Whale Shark">
    <h3>Whale sharks are the largest fish in the world, reaching up to 40 feet (12 meters) long and 20.6 tons (18.7 metric tonnes) in weight.</h3>
    <h3>Despite their massive size, they are gentle giants that feed on tiny plankton, small fish, and crustaceans, using their specialized filtering apparatus in their mouth.</h3>
    <h3>They have over 3,000 tiny teeth, but they don't use them for feeding. They also have teeth-like structures on their eyeballs, probably to protect them from the harsh ocean environment.</h3>
    <h3>They belong to the group of fish that have skeletons made of cartilage, not bone, like sharks, rays, and skates. Their scientific name is Rhincodon typus, meaning "rasp-toothed fish".</h3>
    <h3>They are migratory and can be found in warm waters around the world, from Australia to Mexico. They often gather in large groups for feeding or mating, sometimes forming aggregations of hundreds of individuals.</h3>
    <h3>hey are endangered due to overfishing, habitat loss, and collisions with boats. They can live up to 100 years, but their exact lifespan and reproduction are still poorly understood</h3>
    <hr>
    <h3>Wobbegong Shark</h3>
    <img src="images/wobbegong shark.jpg" alt="Wobbegong Sharks">
    <h3>Wobbegong sharks are not your typical sharks. They look like lumpy carpets with ornate patterns and shaggy beards.</h3>
    <h3>These sharks belong to the family Orectolobidae, which has 12 species of wobbegongs in three genera. They are mostly found in Australia and Indonesia, except for the Japanese wobbegong.</h3>
    <h3>Wobbegongs are bottom-dwellers, preferring to rest on rocks and coral reefs. They use their camouflage to blend in with the ocean floor and ambush their prey.</h3>
    <h3>Wobbegongs are nocturnal hunters, feeding on fish, crustaceans, and sometimes other sharks. They have powerful jaws and sharp teeth that can inflict serious wounds.</h3>
    <h3>Wobbegongs are usually not aggressive to humans, unless provoked or disturbed. They can bite and hold on to divers or snorkelers who get too close or step on them.</h3>
    <h3>Wobbegongs are fascinating and unique sharks that deserve respect and conservation. They are vulnerable to habitat loss, fishing, and pollution.</h3>

    <h3>Nurse Shark</h3>
    <img src="images/Nusre Shark.jpg" alt="Nurse Shark">
    <h3>Nurse sharks adapt well to captivity and are an important species for research, primarily in the area of shark physiology.</h3>
    <h3>The species is fished for food and leather.</h3>

    <h3>Nurse sharks occur in warm tropical and subtropical waters off coasts of the Eastern and Western Atlantic and the Eastern Pacific.</h3>
    <h3>Nurse sharks have a low metabolismand generally expend minimal energy.</h3>
    <h3> While most sharks need to move to breathe, nurse sharks can rest motionless on the sea floor.</h3>
    <hr>
    <h3>Bull Shark</h3>
    <img src="images/Bull Shark.jpg" alt="Bull Shark">

    <h3>Their name comes from their tendency toward shoreline habitats, and they are often seen trolling the ocean floor in the surf zone, very close to shore.</h3>
    <h3>Sand tigers are the only shark known to come to the surface and gulp air.</h3>
    <h3>Sand tiger sharks are denser than water and maintain buoyancy by swallowing air and holding it in their stomachs.</h3>

    <h3>Blacktip reef sharks are small but fierce predators that patrol the coral reefs of the Indo-Pacific region, hunting fish, crustaceans and cephalopods.</h3>
    <h3>Unlike most sharks, they are social animals that form groups of up to 10 individuals. They cooperate to chase and corner their prey, and sometimes perform acrobatic leaps out of the water.</h3>
    <h3>They are viviparous, meaning they give birth to live young, usually four pups at a time. The pups stay in shallow nurseries for protection, and mature around four to seven years old.</h3>
    <h3>They are curious and inquisitive when they encounter divers, but usually shy away if threatened. However, they can become aggressive when there is food involved, especially speared fish or bait.</h3>
    <h3>They are among the most common and resilient sharks in their habitat, but they face threats from overfishing, habitat degradation and climate change. They are considered near threatened by the IUCN.</h3>
    <hr>

    <h3>The basking shark is the second-largest living shark and fish, after the whale shark, and one of three plankton-eating shark species, along with the whale shark and megamouth shark.</h3>
    <h3>The basking shark has an enormous liver that runs over much of their body length and accounts for up to 25% of their body weight. They use it to help it with buoyancy.</h3>
    <h3>The basking shark got its name because they swim slowly and methodically near the surface as they feed.</h3>
    <h3>Basking sharks aren’t afraid of boats or people and will swim close to divers.</h3>
    <h3>Usually solitary, males and females come together to mate during the summer.</h3>
    <h3>During the 20th century, basking sharks were widely fished for their liver oil—used in lamps, cosmetics, perfumes, and lubricants—as well as their meat, skin, and large fins.</h3>
